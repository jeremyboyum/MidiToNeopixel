# Control Neopixels via MIDI

### Watch the tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VdeOb7PoQc

This repo expects that you have a virtual MIDI bus available (in the examples, it's called `VBUS_A`). The tutorial uses Ableton's `External Instrument`, but any DAW or software that can send to a virtual MIDI bus will work.

"Neopixel" is just Adafruit's brand name â€“ any WS2812b LED will work.

Feel free to open an issue with questions or feedback.
